# EarthBnB API
Server API is set up.  

- You can run `npm install`. 
- Then `npm run start`.

If youâ€™ve set up everything correctly you should only see `$ node ./src/bin/www` in your terminal.

Visit `http://localhost:3000/v1` (of course if you have a `PORT` environment variable set, use that) in your browser. You should see the following message:

```json
{
  "message": "Welcome to EarthBnB API"
}
```
